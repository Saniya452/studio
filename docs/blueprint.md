# **App Name**: Gemini Buddy

## Core Features:

- Voice Input: Capture user's voice input using the browser's Web Speech API.
- Gemini AI Integration: Integrate with the Gemini API to process voice-to-text input and generate a response; use the LLM as a tool to decide which of the many possible conversational moves is best.
- Voice Output: Use speech synthesis (Text-to-Speech) to speak the Gemini-generated response.
- Face Animation: Animate the avatar's face to reflect different states (idle, listening, thinking, speaking), with expressions controlled through code.
- Chat Bubbles: Show user input and the robot's responses in a simple chat bubble format.
- Text Subtitles: Display text subtitles during speech to reinforce understanding.
- Thinking Animation: Subtle animations (e.g., blinking dots) while the robot is processing or thinking.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for a futuristic and energetic robot feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2B2B2B) to make the electric blue pop and reduce eye strain.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF), an analogous color to electric blue, used for highlights and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a techy, modern aesthetic.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons for a clean and modern look.
- A clean, single-column layout that highlights the avatar and the ongoing conversation.
- Smooth, subtle animations for state transitions (e.g., listening, speaking) and facial expressions.
